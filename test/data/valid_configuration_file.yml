  # Path to sitemaps to be compiled on "generator".
  # For example: if you have the following url
  #
  #   http://localhost:3000/sitemap_for/users.xml
  #
  # The target must be specified as such
  #
  # Note: you can have multiple targets
  #

  #
  #   http://example.com/sitemaps
  #
  dump_dir: sitemaps
